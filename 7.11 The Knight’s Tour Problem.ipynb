    "Another classic problem that we can use to illustrate a second common graph algorithm is \n",
    "called the “knight’s tour.” \n",
    "Although researchers have studied many different algorithms to solve the knight’s tour problem, a graph search is one of the easiest to understand and program. Once again we will solve the problem using two main steps:\n",

    "- Represent the legal moves of a knight on a chessboard as a graph.\n",
    "- Use a graph algorithm to find a path of length rows×columns−1rows×columns−1 where every vertex on the graph is  \n",
